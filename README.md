<h1>CV SUBMISSION </h1>



<h2>REFLECTION WITH STAR TECHNIQUE</h2>
<br>
Situation:
After the tutorial on how to create a professional CV. The tutorial included practical guidance on structuring the document, what to include in each section, and why each part matters. After completing it, I used what I learned to actually create and submit my own CV.
<br/>

<br>
Task:
I wanted to make sure my CV clearly reflected my skills, experience, and education in a way that would stand out to employers.
<br />

<br>
Action:
I learned that the primary purpose of a CV is to market myself to potential employers—to show that I’m qualified and a good fit for the role. I paid special attention to how to write the work experience section, making sure to list my roles in reverse chronological order, starting with the most recent. I completed the CV  according to requirements 
<br />

<br>
Result:
I had a polished and professional CV that I felt genuinely proud of. Submitting it was a great step forward, and even if I don't hear back right away, I now have a solid document that I can keep updating and using in the future. Creating and submitting the CV made everything I learned in the tutorial feel real and useful—it wasn’t just theory, it was something I could apply immediately.
